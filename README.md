Copycats 
For this module you will extend your HTML/CSS skills by creating copycat versions of components from real sites on the internet. You should try to make your solution as close as possible to the original image. If you have done it perfectly, no one would be able to tell the difference. Also your page must match the desktop, tablet and mobile version of your assigned page.
This will almost certainly involve branching out and learning new CSS properties and stretching your HTML skills.
Create one GitHub repository that will contain all your copycats.
There is a bit of flexibility in requirements for this module. You could spend a ton of time getting each component pixel-perfect. The general goal is to get them very close, but they do not have to be perfect. Some judgment will have to be used by the instructor to determine if they are close enough. Please find your name on the attached document to find your assigned site.
Additional Requirements:
[ ] All styling should be in styles.css
[ ] All images should be served from images/...
[ ] Developed on your laptop in a directory for this project
[ ] CSS rule sets should not target tag names
[ ] External links should open in a new tab# copycat-project
